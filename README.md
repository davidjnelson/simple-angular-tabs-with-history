simple-angular-tabs-with-history
================================

Barebones example of how to do tabs using bootstrap css and angular.  For the simplicity of 
not needing a server, I used hashbang url's instead of html5 history url's.

I included a pom.xml if you want to run it in jetty via maven, just do: `mvn jetty:run` and navigate to http://localhost:8080

This is based off of the fantastic example "angular-resolve" by John Lindquist.  A big shout out to John for all
his great teaching on Angular!!!
